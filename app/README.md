## Notes

Following the video course and learn about this first Assignment of the Android Course, I find it relatively a challenge for me to understand some rules of Kotlin and Android frameworks at the beginning, however, everything becomes better afterwards. Finally, it takes me more than 3 hours to complete the optional task to realize the modify function. I search many things on the website, read the documents and watch some codes and demos. After finishing, I find myself commanding the coding skills for Android much more. Thanks the project for make me interested in programming for Android!
